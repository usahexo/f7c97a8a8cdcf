#  Avalon Scratch Game Coming Soon!

With the success of games such as Minecraft, it was only a matter of time before an Avalon game was created. Avalon Scratch is set to be released in the near future, and promises to be just as addicting as its predecessor.

The premise behind Avalon Scratch is simple – you must gather resources, build structures, and protect your kingdom from invading enemies. The game is played in a 3D environment, and allows for online multiplayer battles. In addition, there are many different kingdoms to choose from, each with their own set of unique features.

Avalon Scratch is still in development, but you can sign up for beta testing now. The developers are looking for feedback from players so that they can make the game even better. So what are you waiting for? Get signed up for beta testing and help shape the future of Avalon Scratch!

#  Avalon Scratch Officially Released!

The much anticipated Avalon Scratch has finally been released! This new scratch-off game offers players a chance to win prizes up to $1,000,000.

To play, players must purchase a ticket and then scratch off the panels to reveal the symbols underneath. If three matching symbols are revealed, the player wins the corresponding prize.

Avalon Scratch is available at retailers throughout the state. Tickets can be purchased for $5, $10, or $20.

Players can also enter their non-winning tickets into the second-chance drawing for a chance to win a prize of $1,000,000. Tickets for the second-chance drawing can be purchased for $10 each.
