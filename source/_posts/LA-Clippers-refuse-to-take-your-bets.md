#  LA Clippers refuse to take your bets

The LA Clippers have had a rough season so far. The team has been riddled with injuries, and is currently in last place in the Western Conference. This has caused the team’s odds of winning the NBA Championship to plummet, and this has left many fans desperate to find a way to make some money on their favorite team.

However, the Clippers have made it clear that they will not be taking any bets for the remainder of the season. This is likely due to the fact that the team does not want to give anyone any false hope that they can actually win the championship.

The Clippers are currently 50/1 to win the NBA Championship, and while there is still a chance that they could pull off an upset, it is looking increasingly unlikely. The Golden State Warriors are currently 2/9 favorites to win the title, while the Houston Rockets are 5/1 second-favorites.

Blake Griffin and Lou Williams are both having good seasons for the Clippers, but they are simply not at the same level as most of the other teams in the NBA. Austin Rivers and Tobias Harris have also been playing well recently, but they are not enough to lead this team to a championship.

The Clippers will likely miss out on making it to the playoffs this year, but there is always next season. Injuries have been a big problem for this team all season long, so if they can stay healthy then they may be able to compete for a playoff spot.

#  Why the LA Clippers don't want your money

The LA Clippers, a team that perennially finds itself in the NBA's top ten in ticket sales, don't want your money.

"It's not about the money," proclaimed Clippers CEO Gillian Zucker. "It's about the fans."

Zucker was referring to the team's recent decision to stop selling individual game tickets and only offer full season ticket packages. The move is an attempt by the Clippers to reward their most loyal fans while also discouraging scalpers and brokers from buying up tickets and reselling them at inflated prices.

The strategy seems to be working, as the Clippers have seen a surge in season ticket sales in the wake of their announcement.

"We've had a great response from our fans," Zucker said. "They understand what we're trying to do and they're excited about it."

What Zucker is doing makes perfect sense for a small-market team like the Clippers. By limiting ticket sales to full season ticket holders only, the club can ensure that its most rabid fans have an opportunity to buy tickets without having to compete with scalpers and brokers. It also allows the team to better monetize its fan base by charging more for full season tickets than it would for individual game tickets.

This isn't to say that the Clippers are opposed to taking your money altogether. They just want you to buy their product in a way that benefits both them and their fans. So next time you're thinking of buying tickets to see Chris Paul and Blake Griffin in action, go ahead and buy a full season package from the Clippers instead. You'll get better seats, you'll help support your favorite team, and you'll save a few bucks too.

#  Clippers Sportbook closed for betting

The NBA's Los Angeles Clippers announced on Monday that their Sportbook has been closed for betting, after an investigation revealed "irregularities" in the operation.

"The irregularities found did not violate any state laws but did result in the Sportbook being closed for betting", said a statement from the Clippers.

No further information was given about the irregularities, but the announcement is sure to send shockwaves through the NBA betting community. The Clippers Sportbook is one of the most heavily bet upon in the league, and its closure could result in a major shuffling of lines across Vegas and beyond.

It is yet unclear what impact this will have on the upcoming playoffs, but it is sure to cause some headaches for oddsmakers. The Clippers are currently seeded fourth in the Western Conference, and are considered by many to be contenders for the title. With their Sportbook now closed for betting, it will be interesting to see how their odds change.

In addition to their Sportbook, the Clippers also operate a casino and a race and sports book. It is unknown if either of these other operations are also being investigated for irregularities.

#  No fun betting on the LA Clippers

The LA Clippers have always been a bit of an enigma in the NBA.

They have all the talent in the world, but they never seem to be able to put it all together.

This year is no different, as they currently sit at 6th in the Western Conference.

While they are certainly still in playoff contention, their odds of making a deep run are slim.

There are simply too many teams in the West that are better than them.

Their best bet is to make some trades before the deadline and try to rebuild for next year.

That being said, there is no fun betting on the Clippers this year.

#  Clippers refuse to let you bet on them

The LA Clippers, fresh off a playoff appearance, are one of the most exciting young teams in the NBA. They feature an All-Star duo in Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, as well as several other intriguing players. This season, they are 9-2 straight up and 5-6 against the spread. Doc Rivers has this team playing very well together on both ends of the floor.

Despite their success so far this year, the Clippers are not a team that you can bet on at this point. The sportsbooks just do not have enough information to make good lines on them. Rivers is a very good coach, but he is still relatively new to the league. He has not been around long enough to establish a consistent track record. You simply cannot rely on his teams to cover spreads on a regular basis.

The Clippers’ offense is one of the best in the NBA. They are averaging 104 points per game and shooting 46 percent from the field. Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are both excellent rebounders and shot blockers, which helps keep opponents’ shots inefficient. Rivers does a great job of getting all of his players involved in the offense, which makes it difficult for opposing defenses to focus on any one player.

Their defense has been inconsistent so far this year, but it looks like it may be coming around. They are currently allowing 99 points per game, which is respectable. If they can continue to improve their defense, they could be a real threat in the Western Conference playoffs.

The bottom line is that the Clippers are an improving team with lots of potential. However, they are not yet a team that you can trust to cover spreads on a regular basis. Wait until Rivers has more experience under his belt before betting on them outright or against the spread
