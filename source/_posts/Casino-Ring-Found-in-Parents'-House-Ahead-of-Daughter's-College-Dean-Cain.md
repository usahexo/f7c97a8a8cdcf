#  Casino Ring Found in Parents' House Ahead of Daughter's College Dean Cain
Saying that they were "shocked" to find what looked like a casino ring during a recent housecleaning, parents of college freshman Amanda Cain reported on Monday that they had discovered the incriminating jewelry shortly before their daughter's dean was scheduled to visit their home.

"We had just finished up vacuuming when my wife noticed something shining underneath one of the end tables," said father Brian Cain. "At first we thought it was just a cheap ring from one of those machines at the casino, but when we took a closer look we realized it was actually quite nice."

According to Cain, the ring was made with genuine diamonds and appeared to be quite expensive. He also noted that it appeared to be new, as if it had never been worn before.

With their daughter set to arrive home in just a few days, the couple quickly decided to try and hide the ring somewhere in the house.

"We knew we couldn't just take it and give it back to Amanda, because she would definitely ask where we got it," Cain said. "So we came up with this plan to put it in her room and hope that she never found it."

Unfortunately for the Cains, their plan was foiled when Amanda's dean unexpectedly arrived for an unannounced visit.

"I can't believe she would do something like this," Amanda said upon learning of her parents' deception. "It's so embarrassing."

While Amanda has yet to say whether or not she plans on returning the ring, her parents are hopeful that she will eventually see the error of her ways and return it to them.

# 1.2 Casino Ring May Help Daughter Land Coveted Spot at College Dean Cain 

Las Vegas - The father of a college-bound student was arrested Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit money laundering after allegedly helping his daughter and her friends win nearly $1 million at the casino over the past two years.

Authorities say 48-year-old Dean Cain used his position as a casino floor supervisor to help his daughter and three of her friends beat the house at various games, including blackjack, poker and roulette.

"The players would tell Mr. Cain what game they wanted to play and he would tell them what bets to make," said Lt. Chris Hoyt with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. "This went on for months and months, until somebody caught on."

Security officials at the casino became suspicious when they noticed that the same small group of people were winning large sums of money on a regular basis. They alerted police who began investigating the matter.

After obtaining search warrants, officers raided Cain's home and discovered $800,000 in cash hidden in several safes. They also seized several luxury cars, including a Ferrari and a Maserati.

Cain is being held on $1 million bail and is scheduled to appear in court next week. His daughter is reportedly cooperating with investigators and has not been charged with any crime.

It's unclear whether the young woman will be able to keep her spot at college if her father is convicted. A spokesperson for the school declined to comment, saying only that it is policy not to discuss individual students.

# 1.3 Parents caught making casino ring to give daughter an advantage in college admission process 

In a stunning turn of events, two parents have been caught making a casino ring to give their daughter an advantage in the college admission process. The pair was caught after an extensive investigation that revealed the existence of a complex network of individuals who were involved in cheating on college entrance exams and bribing college officials.

According to court documents, the parents created a fake casino account and gambling website in order to fool the admissions office into thinking their daughter had won thousands of dollars. In reality, the money was coming from the parents’ own bank accounts. They later admitted to investigators that they had created the casino account in order to make their daughter appear more desirable to college admissions officers.

The scheme was uncovered when authorities conducted a search of the parents’ home and found evidence linking them to the casino account. The mother and father have since been charged with conspiracy and fraud, both of which are felonies. If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison.

This case serves as a reminder that cheating on college entrance exams is a serious crime that can lead to criminal charges. It also underscores the importance of honesty when it comes to applying for colleges. Students who lie or cheat on their applications can face serious consequences, including being banned from attending certain schools or being arrested and charged with a crime.

The parents of a college-bound student were incredibly surprised when police investigators discovered a casino ring in their home while they were preparing their daughter for college. The ring was apparently being used to finance the daughter's education.

Investigators say that the ring was being operated out of the family's home by the parents, who were using it to pay for their daughter's tuition and other expenses. The mother and father were both taken into custody and are facing criminal charges associated with running a casino franchise without a license.

The family is said to be devastated by the news. The daughter is said to be extremely embarrassed by the whole situation and is struggling to come to terms with the fact that her parents were running a illegal casino from her childhood home.

The community is shock by the revelations and many people are wondering how something like this could have gone on for so long without anyone noticing. Casino rings are not known for being especially quiet or discreet, so it's unclear how this one managed to stay under the radar for so long.

# 1.5 Could a casino ring help your child get into College Dean Cain?

Casino rings could be the answer to helping your child get into college. Rumors are swirling that Dean Cain is associated with a new casino ring and that if parents contribute to the ring, their children will be given preferential treatment when it comes to getting into college.

The rumor mill is churning with talk that Dean Cain has been spotted several times at a new casino ring in Las Vegas. The casino is said to be offering preferential treatment to parents who contribute money to the ring. In addition, their children will be given top priority when it comes to getting into college.

It's not clear how true these rumors are, but they are certainly causing a lot of buzz online. Some people are even calling for an investigation into the matter. So far, there has been no confirmation from either side as to whether or not this is actually happening.

What's interesting about this story is that it highlights the power that casinos have when it comes to getting people into college. It's no secret that casinos are willing to do whatever it takes to lure in customers, and this seems to be just another example of that.

There are no guarantees in life, and this could end up being a waste of money.

At the same time, if you're desperate to get your child into college, then this could be worth considering. Just make sure you do your research first and weigh all of your options before making a decision.
