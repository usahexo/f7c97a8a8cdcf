#  Portugal Moves to Legitimate Online Sports Betting

The move is seen as an attempt by the government to boost revenues from online gambling, which have been declining in recent years. In 2016, online gambling netted the government €176 million in taxes, down from €209 million in 2015.

Despite the decline, online gambling remains a popular pastime in Portugal. A study conducted by the University of Lisbon found that nearly 60% of Portuguese adults had gambled online in the past year.

Under the new regulations, only licensed operators will be allowed to offer sports betting services to consumers in Portugal. The operators will be required to pay a licensing fee of €50,000, as well as a monthly tax of €2,500. In addition, they will be required to adhere to strict rules regarding responsible gaming and consumer protection.

"The introduction of a regulated market for online sports betting is good news for both consumers and operators," said Tipico CEO Jörg Strunk. "It will create a level playing field and ensure that players are protected while enjoying a safe and secure gaming experience."
