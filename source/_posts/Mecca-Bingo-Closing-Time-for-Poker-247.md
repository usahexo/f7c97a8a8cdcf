#  Mecca Bingo Closing Time for Poker 247

Just a few short weeks ago, Mecca Bingo players were in uproar as the site closed down it’s popular poker room. The move came as a complete surprise to customers, who were only given a few days notice to find an alternative before the room was closed for good on October 1st.

The closure left many players feeling angry and abandoned, as Poker 247 had been a popular choice among bingo players for years. The site was known for its large player base and generous rewards program, which made it a favorite among online poker enthusiasts.

So what could have led to the sudden closure of this well-loved poker room?

According to sources close to Mecca Bingo, the decision to close the room was made in order to refocus the company’s resources on its core business – bingo. Apparently, Mecca Bingo felt that the poker room was no longer profitable enough to justify keeping it open, and so opted to shut it down instead.

While this may come as a disappointment to many players, there is still hope that Poker 247 may reopen in the future. In the meantime, players are advised to check out some of the other leading poker rooms available online.

#  Mecca Bingo ending its live poker offering

Mecca Bingo is set to close its live poker offering, with the last tournaments taking place on 12th and 13th January.

The news was announced by the company in a statement, with Mecca saying that it had made the decision following a review of its operations. The venue has been running poker tournaments for over a decade, but decided that it was no longer viable to continue.

A spokesman for Mecca said: “After a detailed review of our operations we have taken the decision to discontinue our live poker offering. We would like to thank all our customers who have participated in our tournaments over the years.”

The decision will come as a disappointment to many in the poker community, with Mecca Bingo long considered one of the best places to play in the country. The closure of its poker room follows hot on the heels of Gala Casino shutting down its live offering last year.

There are still plenty of places to play poker in the UK, with Dusk Till Dawn, Grosvenor Casino and The Hippodrome among the most popular venues. However, with Mecca Bingo being such a well-known and respected brand, its closure will be seen as a real blow to the game.

Mecca Bingo is one of the most recognisable bingo brands in the UK, with a history dating back to the 1930s. The company has decided to shut down its Poker 247 room, which will come as a big blow to the online poker community.

Poker 247 had been operational for over 10 years and was popular among players due to its wide range of tournaments and games. However, Mecca has blamed the “current economic conditions” for its decision to close the room, with spokesman Joss Biggs saying that it was no longer economically viable to keep it running.

The news was greeted with disappointment by many in the poker community, who took to social media to express their dismay. One player said that Mecca’s decision was “a real shame”, while another described it as a “massive loss”.

The Poker 247 room will close on 31st March 2017, so there is still time for players to make their final bets. Those who have funds stored in their accounts have been advised to withdraw them before then.

#  Goodbye to Mecca Bingo's Poker 247

It was announced this week that Mecca Bingo will be withdrawing its online poker product, Poker 247, from the market. The move follows a strategic decision by the company to focus on its core bingo offering.

The news will come as a major blow to players who have enjoyed the game at Mecca Bingo for many years. There has been no indication yet as to what might happen to the player pool or to the site's remaining 200 jackpot games.

Mecca Bingo's Poker 247 is not the only online poker product to fold in recent months. The much-loved Full Tilt Poker also announced its closure in August of this year, leaving players with little choice but to look for other sites to ply their trade.

There are still plenty of places to play online poker, but the impending demise of these two big names is sure to be a cause for concern among players. The industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and smaller operators may not be able to survive in such a challenging environment.

#  Farewell to Poker 247 at Mecca Bingo

The online poker room at Mecca Bingo is coming to an end. The closure of the site means that players will have to find a new place to enjoy their favourite card game.

Poker 247 was one of the most popular online poker rooms in the UK and its closure will be a big disappointment to many players. The site has been operating since 2006 and has built up a large player base over the years.

However, Mecca Bingo has decided to close the poker room in order to focus on its core business. The company has not given a reason for the closure, but it is likely that poor performance was a factor.

The decision to close Poker 247 is likely to lead to job losses at the company. There are currently around 100 employees working at the site and they are all at risk of losing their jobs.

The closure of Poker 247 is also a setback for the UK online poker industry. The site was one of the biggest operators in the market and its closure will leave a big hole in the market.

There are already concerns that other operators may follow suit and close their poker rooms in light of regulatory changes that are due to come into effect next year. This could have a negative impact on the industry as a whole and lead to job losses across the sector.

Players who enjoyed playing at Poker 247 can still enjoy their favourite game at other sites such as PokerStars, 888poker, and PartyPoker. These sites offer a wide range of games and stakes and they are sure to satisfy even the most demanding player.
