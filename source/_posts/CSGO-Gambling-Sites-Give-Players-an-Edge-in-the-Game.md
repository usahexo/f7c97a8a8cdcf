#  Why Are So Many Players Using CS GO Gambling Sites?

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS GO) is a popular first-person shooter game that has gained a massive following in the past few years. This has led to the establishment of various CS GO gambling sites, where players can bet on different in-game items. So why are so many players using these sites?

There are a number of reasons why people are drawn to CS GO gambling sites. For starters, these sites offer an opportunity to make money by betting on matches and winning prizes. Additionally, they allow players to gamble with in-game items that they have acquired through playing the game. This can be a fun way to get new items and accessories for their avatar without having to spend any money.

Lastly, CS GO gambling sites provide a sense of excitement and anticipation that is not found in other forms of gambling. By betting on in-game items, players are taking a chance on something that could potentially yield a large payoff. This makes the experience more enjoyable and suspenseful, especially when there is a lot of money on the line.

#  CS GO Gambling Sites: What’s The Big Deal?

If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past few years, you would have heard of the online gaming phenomenon that is <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> (CS:GO). The competitive first-person shooter, originally released in 2012 as a sequel to Half-Life 2‘s popular mod Counter-Strike, has gained an astronomical player base; with over 25 million active players as of early 2018.

One of the most popular activities amongst CS:GO players is gambling. Valve Corporation, the developers of CS:GO, created “weapon skins” which are virtual cosmetic items that can be used to change the appearance of weapons in-game. These skins can be traded and sold on third-party websites (aka skin betting sites) for real money, and often have a high resale value.

Since its inception, skin betting has become a multi-billion dollar industry. However, this legality is somewhat murky; because gambling laws vary from country to country, it is difficult to say whether or not these sites are actually legal. In some countries (e.g., the United States), skin betting is considered illegal under federal law; while in others (e.g., United Kingdom), it is considered legal as long as no real money is wagered.

Regardless of its legality, skin betting has caused significant controversy in the gaming community. Many CS:GO players have accused these sites of being rigged, and having unfair odds that benefit the house (the site owners). This has led to several well-publicized incidents where angry gamers have filed lawsuits against these sites – most notably Pinnacle Sports and EGB.com.

So what’s all the fuss about? Why do people seem to be so up in arms about skin betting? In this article, we will explore three main reasons why people are unhappy with CS:GO gambling sites: allegations of rigging, accusations of underage gambling, and health concerns over addiction.

#Allegations Of Rigging

Since its inception, there have been widespread allegations that skin betting sites are rigged in favour of the house. This suspicion was first brought to light in 2015 by YouTuber Richard Lewis, who produced a video titled “The Dirty Secret of Skin Gambling“. In this video, Lewis accuses several major skin betting sites (including Pinnacle Sports and EGB) of using “custom bots”to automatically win bets.

Lewis claims that these bots are used to manipulate game outcomes in order to maximise profits for the site owners. He also alleges that some site employees have access to privileged information which they can use to place winning bets on behalf of the house. As a result of these claims, many CS:GO players have lost faith in skin betting and stopped using these sites altogether.

In 2016, an independent investigation by Bloomberg into allegations of rigging at two popular skin betting sites (JustBet and BetsOC) found evidence that employees at these sites were actively manipulating game outcomes to earn profits for the house. This evidence included chat logs between employees discussing how to fix matches in order to make money for the site owner. As a result of this investigation, JustBet closed down its operations shortly afterwards.


BetsOC did not face any consequences however as they were based out of Costa Rica (where online gambling is legal). This lack of regulation has been cited as one reason why skin betting continues to be such a controversial topic – there is no overarching governing body responsible for ensuring fair play across all skin betting sites.
