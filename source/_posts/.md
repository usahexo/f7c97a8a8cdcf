Configuring Advanced DHCP Options on a Microsoft Windows Server

DHCP servers can be used to provide clients with various options that affect how they connect to the network. In this article, we will cover how to configure advanced DHCP options on a Microsoft Windows Server.

To begin, open the DHCP management console. In the console tree, right-click DHCP and then click Properties.

In the DHCP Properties dialog box, click the Advanced tab.

On the Advanced tab, you can configure the following options:


· Relay agent information: This option specifies settings for relay agents, which are used to forward DHCP messages between subnets.


· Lease duration: This option sets the length of time for which a client is leased an IP address from a DHCP server. The default lease time is eight days.


· DNS server addresses: This option specifies one or more addresses of DNS servers that clients should use to resolve names into addresses.


· WINS server addresses: This option specifies one or more addresses of WINS servers that clients should use to resolve NetBIOS names into IP addresses.



      NOTE: If you do not specify any DNS or WINS server addresses, clients will use their own configured DNS and WINS servers, if available.



     · Boot file name: This option sets the name of the boot file (usually Bootstrap.ini) that is used by PXE-compliant clients to start up their systems over the network.


· Maximum lease time: This option sets the maximum length of time for which a client can lease an IP address from a DHCP server. The default value is 0xFFFFFFFF (infinite). When this value is set to 0x0, it disables this option and allows unlimited leases.
