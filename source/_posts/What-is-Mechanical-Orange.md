#  What are the controls in Mechanical Orange?

Mechanical Orange is a video game that was released in 2006. The game is set in the future, and you play as an orange that has to navigate its way through a series of mechanical obstacles. The controls are keypad based, and the objective of the game is to guide the orange to the end of each level. There are a total of 52 levels in the game, and each one presents a new challenge.

Some of the obstacles you'll encounter in Mechanical Orange include moving platforms, spinning blades, and laser beams. You'll also have to avoid enemies such as robots and spiders. The controls are fairly simple to learn, but it can take some time to master them. In order to move the orange, you use the arrow keys on the keyboard. To make it jump, you press the spacebar.

Take your time and plan your moves carefully, and you'll be able to get through each level without any problems.
