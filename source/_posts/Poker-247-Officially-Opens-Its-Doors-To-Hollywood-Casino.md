If you're not sure where to start, don't worry - our experts are here to help. We've put together a few tips to help you get started:

1. Learn The Rules - This is probably the most important piece of advice we can give. Before you start playing any type of poker game, make sure you understand the basic rules. That way, you'll be better equipped to make decisions during gameplay and increase your chances of winning.

2. Start Small - Don't go all in on your first hand. Play conservatively until you become comfortable with the game and how the other players play. This will increase your chances of walking away with some winnings instead of losing everything right off the bat.

3. Use Your Bonus - If you're new to Hollywood Casino, take advantage of our bonus offer and start out with extra cash in your account. This will give you a cushion while you're learning the ropes and help reduce some of the risk involved in playing poker games.

4. Seek Advice - If you still feel lost after reading these tips, don't be afraid to ask for advice from other players or casino staff members. They'll be more than happy to help point you in the right direction and increase your chances of winning big bucks at Poker 247!
